        "desc_function": "The CVE description does not explicitly mention any function names. It refers to a misaligned address in the file `smartdns/src/util.c` but does not specify a particular function. \n\nHowever, if the task is strictly to extract any function implied by the context (even if not explicitly named), and considering the file `util.c` is referenced, a possible approach might involve functions within that file related to memory handling. Common functions in such contexts might include memory allocation or alignment functions like `memcpy`, `malloc`, or specific utility functions defined in `util.c`. \n\nBut since the description does not explicitly name a function, the accurate answer is:\n\nNo function is explicitly mentioned in the provided CVE description.",
