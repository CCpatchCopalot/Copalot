        "desc_function": "The CVE description provided does not explicitly mention any specific function or method. \n\nHowever, based on historical context of similar CVEs in Selenium, vulnerabilities related to NULL pointer dereference often involve methods that handle WebDriver commands or element interactions. For example, in Selenium versions prior to 4.14.0, a common source might be methods like **executeScript** (for JavaScript execution) or internal methods related to WebElement handling. \n\nBut strictly adhering to the user's instruction to extract *only* the function mentioned in the provided description (without external analysis), and since the given description does not explicitly name a function, the correct output is:\n\n**No function explicitly mentioned in the provided description.**",
