        "desc_function": "The CVE description does not explicitly mention any specific function or method names. It refers to \"multiple functions in ipmitool\" without naming them.",
        "desc": "It's been found that multiple functions in ipmitool before 1.8.19 neglect proper checking of the data received from a remote LAN party, which may lead to buffer overflows and potentially to remote code execution on the ipmitool side. This is especially dangerous if ipmitool is run as a privileged user. This problem is fixed in version 1.8.19."
