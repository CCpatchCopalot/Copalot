        "desc_function": "sch_sfb enqueue function\n\nBut according to standard Linux kernel naming conventions, this would typically be:\n\nsfb_enqueue\n\nSo the precise answer is:\n\nsfb_enqueue",
        "desc": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel\u2019s networking code. A use-after-free was found in the way the sch_sfb enqueue function used the socket buffer (SKB) cb field after the same SKB had been enqueued (and freed) into a child qdisc. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to crash the system, causing a denial of service."
