        "desc_function": "The CVE description does not explicitly mention any specific function or method names. The vulnerability is related to the interaction between higher level SRTP transport and lower level transports like ICE, but no function names are provided in the text. \n\nHowever, if forced to infer based on the described components, the affected areas might relate to transport synchronization mechanisms (e.g., functions managing SRTP and lower transport layers), but these are not explicitly named in the provided description. \n\nFinal answer:  \nNo specific function or method names are explicitly mentioned in the provided CVE description.",
        "desc": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerability\u2019s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch."
