        "desc_function": "The CVE description does not explicitly mention any specific function names, only the file `mariadb_lib.c`. Therefore, no functions can be extracted based on the provided information. \n\nHowever, if we consider the context of the vulnerability (improper validation of OK packets), the likely function involved is:\n\n`mysql_read_ok_packet`\n\nThis function is commonly responsible for processing OK packets in MySQL/MariaDB client libraries, even though it isn't explicitly named in the CVE description. \n\nFinal answer:\n```\nmysql_read_ok_packet\n```",
        "desc": "libmariadb/mariadb_lib.c in MariaDB Connector/C before 3.1.8 does not properly validate the content of an OK packet received from a server. NOTE: although mariadb_lib.c was originally based on code shipped for MySQL, this issue does not affect any MySQL components supported by Oracle."
