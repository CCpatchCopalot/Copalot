Yes. The provided patch addresses an unrelated check constraint issue (SR362, #1177) rather than the described box_equal DoS vulnerability. There are no relevant modifications to streamline for the given vulnerability description.

The patch appears completely unrelated to the described box_equal vulnerability. A proper fix would modify the box_equal function instead. This commit should be disregarded for the mentioned DoS issue.
