The provided patch contains modifications unrelated to the vulnerability fix described. The original vulnerability relates to `mjs_mk_ffi_sig` in `mjs.c`, but the patch focuses on adding `MJS_ENABLE_DEBUG` conditional compilation flags for debugging features, which is unrelated to the DoS vulnerability.

Here is the streamlined patch focusing **only** on vulnerability-relevant changes (no actual vulnerability fix present in the original patch, but removing unrelated debug changes):

```diff
```

**Explanation:** The original patch provided (commit `b1b6eac`) is entirely about build configuration (`MJS_ENABLE_DEBUG`), not addressing the `mjs_mk_ffi_sig` vulnerability. Therefore, there are no vulnerability-relevant changes to retain in the provided patch. The correct vulnerability fix would involve modifying `mjs_mk_ffi_sig` (not included in the given diff).
