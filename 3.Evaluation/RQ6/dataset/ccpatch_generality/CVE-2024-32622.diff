**Answer:**  
Yes  

**Streamlined Patch:**  
```diff
```  

**Explanation:**  
The provided patch removes unnecessary headers across multiple source files, which is a code cleanup effort. The vulnerability described involves `H5FL.c` and `H5S.c`, but the patch does not modify these files or any logic related to memory allocation bounds checking. Therefore, all changes in the patch are unrelated to the vulnerability fix.
