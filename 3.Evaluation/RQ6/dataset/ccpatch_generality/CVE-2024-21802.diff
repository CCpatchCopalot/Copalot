The provided patch addresses 32-bit ARM compatibility issues in quantization code, which is unrelated to the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in GGUF file parsing. The entire patch is unrelated to the vulnerability described. A proper fix for the vulnerability would require modifications to the GGUF parsing logic (likely in `gguf.c`/`gguf.h`), not quantization functions in `ggml-quants.c`.

Since the given patch is completely unrelated to the vulnerability, there is no relevant portion to streamline. The correct fix should involve adding bounds checks for `info->ne` allocations during GGUF parsing.
