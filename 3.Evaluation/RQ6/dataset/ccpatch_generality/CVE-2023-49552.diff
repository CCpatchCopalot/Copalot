The provided patch is entirely unrelated to the vulnerability described (Out of Bounds Write in `mjs_op_json_stringify`). The patch focuses on build configuration (`MJS_ENABLE_DEBUG`) and debug features, not addressing the vulnerability. Since there is no actual security fix in the provided patch, no streamlined patch can be derived from it. The correct vulnerability fix would involve changes to the `mjs_op_json_stringify` function, which is not present in the given diff.
