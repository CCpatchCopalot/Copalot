The provided patch adds statements to suppress unused parameter compiler warnings across multiple files. These changes are unrelated to the actual vulnerability fix for the out-of-bounds write issue in the `GetAttributeList` functionality. The vulnerability fix would require addressing the attribute count validation and buffer management in the relevant code, which is not present in this patch.

**Streamlined Patch (No vulnerability-related changes found):**  
Since the entire patch only contains unrelated modifications (unused parameter suppressions), there is no vulnerability-specific fix to retain. The original patch should be disregarded for addressing the described vulnerability, and a separate fix targeting the `attribute_count_request` handling in `GetAttributeList` would be necessary.
