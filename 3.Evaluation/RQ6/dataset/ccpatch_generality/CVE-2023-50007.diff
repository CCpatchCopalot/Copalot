Yes

The provided patch addresses a crash in `af_afwtdn` (unrelated to the described buffer overflow in `libavutil/samplefmt.c`). Since the patch is entirely unrelated to the vulnerability, **no valid streamlined patch can be created from it**. The correct fix for the described buffer overflow should modify `libavutil/samplefmt.c`, not `libavfilter/af_afwtdn.c`. 

**Note:** This appears to be a mismatch between the vulnerability description and the provided patch.
