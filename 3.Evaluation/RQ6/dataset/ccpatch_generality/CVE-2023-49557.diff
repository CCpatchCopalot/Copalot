The provided patch modifies `libyasm/expr.c` to address a null-pointer-dereference in `yasm_expr_get_intnum`. However, the vulnerability description explicitly refers to a denial-of-service issue in the **`yasm_section_bcs_first` function** in **`libyasm/section.c`**. The patch does not touch `section.c` or the mentioned function, indicating it addresses a different vulnerability (likely #244 in the commit message). 

Streamlined patch (empty, as the original patch is unrelated to the described vulnerability):

*Note: The actual fix for the described vulnerability in `section.c` is not included in the provided patch.*
