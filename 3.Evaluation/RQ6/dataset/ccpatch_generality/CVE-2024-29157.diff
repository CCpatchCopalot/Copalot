The provided patch removes unnecessary headers across various source files but does not include any changes related to the H5HG_read vulnerability described. The vulnerability fix would require modifications to the H5HG_read function to address the heap buffer overflow, which is not present in this header cleanup patch.

Since the entire patch is unrelated to the vulnerability, there is no streamlined patch to provide. The correct fix for the HDF5-1.14.3 heap buffer overflow in H5HG_read would be a separate commit addressing bounds checking or buffer management in that specific function.
