**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

The provided patch primarily adds conditional compilation directives (`#if MJS_ENABLE_DEBUG`) around debug-related code to allow building without debug features. The vulnerability described involves a denial of service in `mjs_destroy` in `msj.c`, which is not modified in the patch. The changes in the patch are unrelated to resource management or fixes in `mjs_destroy`, indicating the presence of unrelated modifications.

**Answer:**

Yes

**Streamlined Patch:**

Since the original patch does not address the `mjs_destroy` vulnerability and only contains unrelated debug configuration changes, there is no relevant portion to streamline for the described vulnerability. The correct fix would require a different patch targeting the actual vulnerability in `mjs_destroy`. 

However, if the task is to remove unrelated changes from the provided patch (even though none are related to the vulnerability), the answer remains the same as the original patch does not include the fix.
