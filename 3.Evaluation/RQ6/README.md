To demonstrate the generality of Copalot in real-world scenarios,we constructed a new dataset containing both tangled patches and CC patches. The results is in [RQ6 results](results.json).
- The raw results of `PRIMEVUL` is shown in [prime_vul_results](prime_vul_results), the raw results of `VMUD` is shown in [vmud_results.json](vmud_results_generality.json), the raw results of `GPT-4O` is shown in [results_4o](results_4o), and the raw results of `Copalot` is shown in [results_ours](results_ours).

To get the results of the baselines on the generality dataset, follow the similiar step of RQ4.
