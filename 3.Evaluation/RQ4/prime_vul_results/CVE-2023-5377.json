    "desc_function": "The CVE description provided does not explicitly mention any specific function or method. \n\nHowever, if we consider common scenarios where such vulnerabilities might occur in a multimedia framework like GPAC, potential functions/methods related to parsing media formats (e.g., `gf_isom_parse_movie`, `gf_isom_box_parse`) could be involved. But since the description does not specify, no function can be definitively extracted."
