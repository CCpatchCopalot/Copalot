The top vulnerability-related call chain modification is the introduction of `Curl_hsts_loadfiles` with proper locking to prevent concurrent HSTS cache overwrites:

This change adds HSTS file loading with locking during the pretransfer phase, directly addressing the race condition by ensuring synchronized access to the HSTS cache when multiple transfers occur in parallel.
