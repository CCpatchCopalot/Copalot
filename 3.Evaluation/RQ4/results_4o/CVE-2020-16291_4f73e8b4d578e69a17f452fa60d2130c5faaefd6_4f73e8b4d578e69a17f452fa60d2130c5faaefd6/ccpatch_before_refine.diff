To identify the most relevant vulnerability-related call chain modification, we analyze the patch's impact on initialization routines and parameter handling that could lead to buffer overflow.

**Key Modification:**
- **Removal of `cdj970_one_time_initialisation`** and direct call to `cdj970_write_header` in `cdj970_print_page`.
- **Initialization moved to `hp_colour_open`** ensures critical parameters (resolution, margins) are set early, preventing incorrect memory allocation during PDF processing.

     }

```

**Reasoning:**  
This change addresses improper initialization timing where device parameters (resolution/margins) affecting buffer sizes were set too late. By moving critical setup to `hp_colour_open`, memory allocation for scan lines uses correct values upfront, mitigating buffer overflow during PDF rendering.
