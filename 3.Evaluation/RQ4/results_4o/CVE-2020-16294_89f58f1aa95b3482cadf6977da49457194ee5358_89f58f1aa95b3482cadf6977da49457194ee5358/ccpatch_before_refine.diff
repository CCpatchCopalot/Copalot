The most critical vulnerability-related modification is the addition of the `x_dpi` bounds check to prevent out-of-bounds array access in `epsc_print_page()`, which addresses the buffer overflow. This impacts the call chain by adding an early error return before reaching `epsc_output_run`.

This diff adds bounds checking for `x_dpi` before using it to index into the graphics mode arrays. If violated, it returns an error early, preventing the vulnerable buffer overflow codepath from being reached. The call chain is modified by introducing this validation prior to calling `epsc_output_run`, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
