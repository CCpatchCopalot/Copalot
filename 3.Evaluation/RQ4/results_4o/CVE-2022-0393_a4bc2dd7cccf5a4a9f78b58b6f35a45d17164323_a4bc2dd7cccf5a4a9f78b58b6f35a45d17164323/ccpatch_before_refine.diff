The provided patch modifies the `delete_buff_tail` function in `src/getchar.c` to address a potential out-of-bounds read by adding NULL checks for `buf->bh_curr` and `buf->bh_curr->b_str`. This prevents dereferencing invalid pointers, which could lead to reading memory out-of-bounds. The critical diff is:

```diff

```

This modification ensures that `STRLEN` is not called on a NULL pointer, directly mitigating the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
