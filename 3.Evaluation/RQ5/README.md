We created six ablated versions for Copalot; i.e., (1)identifying critical functions using the LLM without the coarse-grained patch features (w/o 𝐶𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 ); (2) removing the critical function chains construction module (w/o 𝐹𝐶); (3)switching GPT-4o to GPT-3.5 (w/𝐺𝑃𝑇-3.5);(4)removing the equivalent transformation module (w/o𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠);(5)identifying critical statements using the LLM without the fine-grained patch features(w/o𝑆𝑒𝑞); and(6)removing the monitor(w/o𝑚𝑛𝑡𝑟). See [RQ5 results](results.json).

To get the results of the ablated versions, follow the similiar step of RQ4.
