comment: /* Since we need 600 and 300 dpi, we set up several buffers: storage contains the data as copied from gs, as well as the plane-data and the out_row buffer. storagec will contain the rescaled color data. It also contains the plane_data for the color-planes - these are needed by the compression routine, but would be overwritten by the b/w-dithering. The color planes allow for overwriting the color-data by the error-data. Since we might use the 2bpp feature of the hp970 someday, it is sized like storage. storagee contains the errors from b/w fs-ditherng */  @ 655 @ comment: /* Since we need 600 and 300 dpi, we set up several buffers: storage contains the data as copied from gs, as well as the plane-data and the out_row buffer. storagec will contain the rescaled color data. It also contains the plane_data for the color-planes - these are needed by the compression routine, but would be overwritten by the b/w-dithering.
